# Double Well potential

The Langevin dynamics of a particle in a double well potential will be studied here.

## Instructions to run the simulation

The instructions to run the molecular dynamics simulation of this system can be found in the jupyter notebook [1_running_the_simu.ipynb](./1_running_the_simu.ipynb).
